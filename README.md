## Welcome to the debugging challenge!

### Rules

* No cheating, no helping your neighbor or getting help.
* Google is 100% okay
* Looking at other people's repositories for this challenge is not okay.
* Rules for each challenge are in a README in each challenge folder.
* To get credit for a fix you must document it in the fixes.txt file
    * You must include what the bug was, what steps you took to find the bug, how you solved it.
* Final solution should be submitted via pull request back to the master repo.


### Scoring

* To win, all bugs must be found, solved and documented.
* In the case of no one finishing, the winner will be the developer with the most bugs fixed and documented before the hour is up.
* In the case of a tie, the winner will be determined by who has the best documentation in their fixes.txt files.
